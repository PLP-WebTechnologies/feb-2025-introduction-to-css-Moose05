  <p class="intro">
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. 
    While HTML structures the content on a webpage, CSS controls how that content appearsâ€”such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
  </p>

  <p class="intro">
    CSS connects to HTML by either being written directly in the HTML file (inline or in a &lt;style&gt; tag) or by linking to an external file like this one. 
    This makes it easy to keep design separate from content, making web pages cleaner and easier to manage.
